# PHP Design Patterns Examples
Sample code for several design patterns in PHP to demonstrate the basic fundamentals of behavioral, creational and structural patterns.  

Code also shows the ability to test different oop code bases with phpunit, makdown knowledge and git versioning and tagging.  


* **Decorator:** One class takes in another class, both of which extend the same abstract class, and adds functionality.
* **Observer:** An object notifies other object(s) if it changes.
* **Strategy:** 	An object controls which of a family of methods is called. Each method is in its` own class that extends a common base class.
* **Chain Of Responsibility:** A behavioral design pattern that processes a request through a series of handlers/receivers objects.
* **Null Object:** Using instances of a concrete class that implements a known interface, instead of null references.
* **Front Controller:** All requests that come for a resource in an application will be handled by a single handler.
* **Facade:** A structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.
